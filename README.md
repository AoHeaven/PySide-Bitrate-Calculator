![PySide Bitrate Calculator](/screenshots/bitrate_calculator.png)

The program was written for myself, but was uploaded for everyone to use.

## Main
**PySide Bitrate Calculator** allows you to calculate the average bitrate of a video. All you need is the video file itself. You can also enter the results manually.

## Languages currently supported

## Required libraries
To run the program, you need pre-installed libraries such as `PySide6` and `OpenCV`. To install them, enter `cmd`:
```
pip install pyside6
pip install opencv-python
```
Or install the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt`:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To install the libraries above, you need [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/).
## Launch
To run the program, you need the [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter and the libraries mentioned above installed. After installation, run the file `bitrate_calculator.pyw`.

## Future plans
